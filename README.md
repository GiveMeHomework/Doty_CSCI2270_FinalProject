# Doty_CSCI2270_FinalProject
	The program I made will take user inputs and use them to choose a node that relates to what the user wants. The nodes have a weighted network format similar to the cities problem extra credit. The user is able to create nodes and edges, as well as print the current network vertices. After this there are two methods availible to the user to solve for the shortest path between two points.

HOW TO RUN
	The program begins by building a test network. From here a menu will be displayed and the user can choose what to do from there. Any option is availible from the beginning.

For example, selecting 1 will promp the user to "add a dog"
At which point the user types in the dogs name.

After that they can connect the dog to existing dogs via the "2" option in the menu.

If they don't want to do anything else, they select "6" to quit
